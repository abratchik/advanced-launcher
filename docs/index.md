Kodi Plugin: Advanced Launcher
==

Latest version: 2.6.2
--

In order to continue to provide this functionality which has been much missed since AngelsCry's repo was taken down, I have taken it upon myself to rebuild and re-develop advanced launcher, so that it is both more functional and more stable than it has been.

Basic Installation
--
I haven't made a zip release yet, nor have I sorted out repository distribution. Ideally I'd
like to get it into the kodi main repo.

Configuration

More to come


Getting an API key from thegamesdb.net
--

It's a bit of a pain to get an API key from thegamesdb.net, I suppose they're trying to manage traffic a bit and I'm not sure if I can share the public API key I was given, so for now there's no key in the distribution.

In order to obtain your gamesdb api key you need to:
- Register with the site, verify your email address etc...
- Post in the API key forum topic that you want an API key
- Wait for the key to be given to you


Supported emulators
--

Tested means that it's been working or is working, supported means that we have a solid set of command line options that are automatically applied to the emulator to run the game. Supported offers seamless integration, for starting and exiting a game, so that may take a while to get filled out...
